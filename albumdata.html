	<h1>It looks like all albums have been claimed so there is no need for new album data anymore. Thanks to all contributors! This page will be updated when it's ready to add LPs and EPs.</h1>
	
	<del>Albums that are available on the browser right now: <span id="available-albums"></span><br>
	<b>Also make sure to check <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Monstercat/comments/4py29z/please_help_adding_album_data_into_the_monstercat/" target="_blank">this reddit post</a> to see what albums people are planning to add so that there won't be any duplicates.</b></del><br><br>

	Contributing an album data to the site is actually quite simple, simple PM me at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/gamehelp16/" target="_blank">/u/gamehelp16</a> and include these information:<br><br>
	
	1. Album number and name (example: 027 - Cataclysm).<br>
	2. Upload the large version of the album art to imgur and include the link on the PM (example: https://i.imgur.com/j1fZsYB.jpg). Album art should be at least 1000x1000px in size and make sure it doesn't contain the monstercat logo on the top right corner (make sure the url is using https. If it is not, simply change http to https).<br>
	3. Go to the <a href="http://monstercat.wikia.com/" target="_blank">Monstercat Wiki</a> page of the album and copy the table of the tracklist so the copied data looks like what you see below, make sure that you did NOT copy the album mixes!<br><br>
	Copied data should look like this:<br>
<pre>1	Grabbitz	Float Away	Indie Dance	3:14

	4. Insert the data into the input field and press the button.<br><br>
	
	<textarea id="input" style="width:300px;height:200px" placeholder="input field (see input example above)"></textarea><br>
	<input type="button" value="Process" onclick="process()"><br><br>
	<textarea id="output" style="width:300px;height:200px" placeholder="output"></textarea><br><br>
	<i>(Apparently sometimes the data generated doesn't include the last track, so make sure that they do exist!)</i><br><br>
	
	5. If you take a look at the generated data there are a lot of text saying "&lt;soundcloud link for '(song name)'&gt;", replace those with the SoundCloud url for the track mentioned (example: https://soundcloud.com/monstercat/unlike-pluto-waiting-for-you). Make sure the url is using https, if it is not simply change http to https. And also the URL doesn't need to be surrounded by the "&lt;&gt;" brackets.<br>
	6. After putting the SoundCloud link, copy the data generated to a site like pastebin.com and include the link to the PM.<br>
	7. Last, include on the PM the name and the SoundCloud URL of album mixes of the album.<br><br>

	That's it, thank you for your contribution!<br><br>
	
	PS: If you know what JSON is and have a GitHub account, you can make my job easier by constructing the whole JSON file of the album data and submit a pull request to https://github.com/gamehelp16/monstercat-browser. You can take a look at examples of finished album data (<a href="albums/026.json">026</a> or <a href="albums/027.json">027</a>) or start from a <a href="albums/blank.json">blank</a> template.<br><br>
	Also a tip: actually you only need to upload the large version of the artwork, to get the smaller version simply add "m" before the file extension on the URL (example: https://i.imgur.com/7DJVBVhm.jpg).<br><br>
	Also, if you're gonna make an album data for an LP / EP, you don't need to send them right now because when I'm typing this I have not "standarized" the JSON format for LPs / EPs yet so you probably will have to change it later.
